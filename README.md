## Reflect

It is very importent to test method and functions in isolation to verify that they perform as expected and follow the specifications. Edge cases is most important to test because there is usually where an error will occur. It is also of importance to integrate the unit tests as automated tests in the CI workflow. Then the tests will run whenever a collaborative member push a code update. This will ensure that changes done to the code do not destroy other parts of the code.
